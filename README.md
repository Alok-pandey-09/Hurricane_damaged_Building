# Hurricane_damaged_Building
The latest hurricane - Hurricane Iota, had 61 total fatalities, and 41 are still missing. After a hurricane, damage assessment is vital to the relief helpers and first responders so that resources and help can be planned and allocated appropriately.
One way to measure the damage is to detect and quantify the number of damaged buildings, usually done by driving around the affected area and noting down manually.
This process can be labor-intensive and time-consuming and not the most efficient method as well.
I am trying to build a model that helps in classifying buildings that were damaged by hurricane to help relief teams identify which areas need most help.
